# Hello, World!

This is the code repo for my personal art site. I started to build this when I needed to have example code for a job application. Anyone who works in the SDE field knows that it's common to work 99% of the time in private repos. And of course, sharing any of that code would be unethical. In comes this project. It's been a fun side project for my software development day job. Actually, painting has been a fun side project too. So really, this site is a side project for my side project.


## Nerds

It's built with Sanity.io for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, and Bootstrap for the base UI. Also, I have added Easter eggs for y'all to find.
